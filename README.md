# A simple powershell script for generating a Next.js project quickly
Just download and right click to run with powershell. By default, it will create a project named "next-project" but this can be changed to a different name or omitted from the script to have it ask you every time. The script also automatically opens VS Code assuming you have `code .` enabled.

## Defaults (these can be changed by modifying the script)

* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* ESLint
* App Directory
* Src Directory
* NPM
* '@/*' (Default Import Alias)
